# gordian-gen


This project/experiment is considered **dead**, however this was an experiment to
add some type checking and automation/correctness into how BitVectors were generated from Haskell ADTs.

Unfortunately, this codebase is pretty impenetrable, but will also provide a lot of fun for the Haskell enthusiast.


The core idea of how auto derivation works can be found in `BitVecRepr.hs`, specs can also be written
like as performed in `CoreAbstract.hs`.
